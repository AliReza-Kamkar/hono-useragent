# UserAgent Parser Middleware for [Hono](https://hono.dev/) ðŸ”¥

hono-useragent is a simple middleware that uses [ua-parser-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js) under the hood to parse useragent from request header with improved type safty.

## Installation
You can install this package with bun
```bash
bun install hono-useragent
```
or you can use npm with this command
```bash
npm i hono-useragent
```

## Usage overview
Simple hono app with useragent middleware
```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import useragent from 'hono-useragent';

// create hono app
const app = new Hono();

// attach middleware to app
app.use(useragent());

app.get('/', (c) => {
  const ua = c.useragent;
  return c.json({
    browser: ua.browser?.name,
    version: ua.browser?.version,
    os: ua.os?.name
  });
});

As I mentioned before, we use <code>ua-parser-js</code> under the hood.
You can use these parameters in <code>c.useragent</code> object.
